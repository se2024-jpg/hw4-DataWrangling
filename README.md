# HW4-Data Wrangling

## Introduction
Data wrangling, also called data munging, is the process of cleaning, transforming, and organizing raw data into a usable format for analysis or reporting. This tutorial will cover key command-line tools and techniques used in Linux and macOS terminals for efficient data wrangling. If you're on Windows, you can use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

## Pipes
Pipes allow inter-process communication by directing the output of one process to another. A fundamental tool in Unix-based systems, the pipe (represented by `|`) connects commands for streamlined data processing.

### Example Commands:
- `ls`: Lists files and directories.
- `wc -l <filename>`: Counts lines in a file.
  
### Example Pipe Usage:
```bash
ls | wc -l
```
